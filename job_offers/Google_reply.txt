Namaste,

It's very kind of you to write to me for potential association with Google. 
Like a lot of others, we too are facing an unprecedented crisis and it has hit the regular academic and research activities.
Currently, my research focusses broadly on serverless computing and previously I have worked on distributed data stores for IoT Edge.
At present, I am in the middle of my core research in the PhD programme. 
However, I will definitely write to you for any possible mutually beneficial association with Google.
As a normal end-user of the services, I applaud the efforts of Google on their services to spread awareness and their research efforts in tackling the on-going Pandemic.
Thanks once again. I hope we cross-ways ahead soon.
